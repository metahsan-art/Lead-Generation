## Option 3: Deploy to Your Own Server

### Step 1: Build the Application
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with production files.

### Step 2: Upload to Your Server

Upload the `dist` folder contents to your web server (via FTP, SFTP, or SSH).

### Step 3: Configure Web Server

#### For Nginx:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name b2b-lead-generation.com www.b2b-lead-generation.com;
    root /var/www/b2b-lead-generation;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # SSL configuration (recommended)
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;
}
```

#### For Apache (.htaccess):
```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

### Step 4: Point Domain to Server

Update DNS records at your domain registrar:
- **A Record**: Point `b2b-lead-generation.com` to your server's IP address
- **CNAME Record**: Point `www` to `b2b-lead-generation.com`

### Step 5: Setup SSL Certificate (Important!)

Use Let's Encrypt for free SSL:
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d b2b-lead-generation.com -d www.b2b-lead-generation.com
```

## Environment Variables (Future Use)

When you integrate real APIs, create a `.env` file:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://api.b2b-lead-generation.com
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

**Never commit `.env` to Git!** Add it to `.gitignore`.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "404 Not Found" on refresh
**Solution**: Ensure your server is configured for SPA routing (see nginx/apache config above)

### Issue: CSS not loading
**Solution**: Check the base URL in `vite.config.ts` and ensure all assets are properly referenced

### Issue: Domain not resolving
**Solution**: 
- Check DNS propagation: https://dnschecker.org
- Wait 24-48 hours for DNS to fully propagate
- Verify DNS records are correct at your registrar

### Issue: HTTPS not working
**Solution**: Install SSL certificate using Let's Encrypt or your hosting provider's SSL
